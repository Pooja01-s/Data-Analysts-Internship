# Data-Analysts-Internship
I have used Lung_cancer datasets and tweet dataset from kaggale datasets for analysis.
Analyze and extract insights from a large dataset using scalable tool like dask, then build a predictive machine learning model (such as regression or classification) to forecast outcomes. Visualize your findings through an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau, Power BI. Additionally, perform sentiment analysis on textual data (e.g., tweets, reviews) using NLP techniques to uncover emotional trends and user feedback.
